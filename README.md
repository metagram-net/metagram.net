# Metagram

All the code for [metagram.net](https://metagram.net)

## What is this?

Metagram is my web development playground. I someday dream of having a network
of apps that are useful, interesting, or fun to work on.

Right now, there's just [Firehose], a very opinionated personal content queue.

## Join me!

I welcome contributions from anyone who finds a way to make this better.

In particular, I appreciate these things:
- Pull requests with clear motivation (tests are nice too!)
- Bug reports with reproducible setup instructions
- Ideas about things that work but can be improved
- Comments in issues and PRs to help me write better code

I will gladly help you with setup instructions (which you can use as your first
PR!) if you email me.
