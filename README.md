# Metagram

All the code for [metagram.net](https://metagram.net)

This project has given me so many years of learning, but it's time for it to
finally come to an end. It turns out that a combination of [linkding] and
[Miniflux] is already way better than what I had planned to build for Firehose,
so that's what I'm using now.

This project evolved from Go microservices to a Rails modular-monolith to a
giant pile of Rust code. Deployment moved out of ephemeral containers on a
[DigitalOcean] VM onto the VM itself, and then became a set of [Fly.io]
machines. Everything was always Postgres the whole time ðŸ˜‰

If you find yourself wanting to ask me questions about the code you find in
here (or anything else related to this), please email me!

## What is this?

Metagram is my web development playground. I someday dream of having a network
of apps that are useful, interesting, or fun to work on.

Right now, there's just [Firehose], a very opinionated personal content queue.
